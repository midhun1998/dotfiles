# Config management
This repository hosts various config files such as .tmux.conf, .zshrc, .vimrc, etc.
The whole motive is to switching between the systems easily without having to match each config one at a time. 


<!--## Getting started

I use GNU Stow to manage my symlinks. You will install the latest Stow when following the instructions below. If you prefer to use a specific version then browse [this](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/stow/).
```bash
$ REPO_ROOT=$(pwd)		# Assuming you are currently in the cloned location of this repository
$ cd /tmp && wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/stow/stow-latest.tar.gz
$ tar xzf stow-latest.tar.gz
$ cd stow-*/
$ ./configure && make

# ?? More to add here

```
